**Terrain generator and visualizer**
*Project for university*

Uses:
- GLFW for window management
- GL3W for OpenGL function loading
- OpenGL for rendering
- GLM for math

**TODO**: 
- Rule-based generation
- Recursive layers
- Dynamic parameters
- Statistics
- GUI
- Export
 
To build the project run *make* in project directory. GLSL shader files expected to be in the same directory as an executable. You will also need to create a *function* directory for project to work.
