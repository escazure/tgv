**Terrain generator and visualizer**
*Project for university*

Uses:
- GLFW for window management
- GL3W for OpenGL function loading
- OpenGL for rendering
- GLM for math
- Dear ImGui for GUI

**TODO**: 
- Terrain regeneration
- Dynamicly adjustable parameters
- Statistics
- GUI
- Export
 
To build the project run *make* in the project directory. 
GLSL shader files are expected to be in the same directory as an executable.
You will also need to create a *function* directory for project to work.
